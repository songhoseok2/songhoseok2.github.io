          An Android application that estabilshes a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection 
          between the app's client written in Java and a Desktop Computer's server written in 
          Python to grant the user a remote access to the PC. The app features a full virtual 
          keyboard, mouse cursor movement, First Person Shooter game control 
          (my personal interests in games) and a list of hotkeys for the computer.

            A project that simulates a simple bank account balance tracker. Program is able to read 
            or write on the bank account balances from multiple users simultaneously through a TCP 
            Window socket connection using multi-threaded system. The bank balance data is managed 
            through a set-associative cache system with features such as Least Recently Used(LRU), 
            Dirty Bit and write-back policies.

            A Python script that allows the user to view all news articles from CNN / Fox News 
            except for the ones that contain the keywords user inputs into the provided filter.
            Unlike the conventional filters that provide articles that contain the keyword and 
            discard the rest, this filter in opposite is used to view all the general headlines 
            while discarding the ones that contain the keyword. This filter is useful when the user 
            wishes to view all the headlines in the main page spanning multiple sections discarding 
            only the unwanted articles.

              Computerized the old military sentry / guard duty scheduling system by developing a 
              C++ program to automatically generate a schedule that is fairer and more efficient 
              than creating the schedule by hand. I Designed the data structures including a custom 
              functor for the priority queue based on the conventional scheduling system and 
              modified the program regularly as the scheduling rules changed or as the CO requested.

              3DSSPP software is a C++ job simulation program that provides posture data, 
              force parameters, male/ female anthropometry, static strength requirements for tasks 
              such as lifts, presses, pushes, and pulls. The software can aid the analyst in designs

              I was responsible for the updates of the outdated codes to newer versions to make the 
              project compatible with Visual Studio 2015, design of the UI, debugging and 
              optimization of human module rendering and the development of the module's ankle

                A real time strategy (RTS) game developed with Unity engine during the Game Jam 
                hosted by the Wolverine Soft. The game was developed by a team of 2 programmers, 
                1 musician and an artist. The player is a king who tries to protect the castle from 
                the rioters, and controls the soldiers spawnable during the preparation phase to 
                fight enemies that grow larger in number as the stage progresses.
