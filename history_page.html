          I served my mandatory military service at the 36th Infantry Division, 109th regiment in 
          Korea as a machinegunner, and was assigned as a squad leader in October 2018 until 
          I completed my service.

          In February 2018, the military provided the government security and 
          workforce for the Pyeong Chang Winter Olympics, and I was deployed there as well.
          I worked as a security staff in the Alpensia Sliding Centre for games such as Skeleton, 
          Luge and Bobsleigh, and as a translator between the staff and the atheletes.

          I also volunteered for a project to improve the flawed sentry / guard scheduling system 
          of the base. The conventional scheduling system had fairness issue in which the schedule 
          was often unfairly biased towards certain troopers. The Non Commissioned Officer (NCO) 
          who was in charge of the system was also in agony due to having to go thorugh the entire 
          company's list everyday single handedly to schedule the duties. 
          I removed the unfair bias and lessened the officer's burden by building a software 
          that goes through the trooper's database and generate a schedule that is fair to all 
          the troopers based on their most recent duties.

          Wolverine Soft is an organization in the University of Michigan where the members meet 
          regulary to discuss, make critiques and share their knowledge about video game development 
          using Unity Engine. Members also participate in an game development marathon event called 
          the Game Jam in which teams consist of programmers, sound engineers and artists develop a 
          fully furnished game within 48 hours.

          University of Michigan Solar Car Team is a team that aims for the annual 
          World Solar Challenge. I was initially stationed in the Electrical division, where I was 
          responsible for the design of the cell connections of the battery of the car using 
          Computer Aided Design(CAD) such as Siemens NX and Altair Hyperworks. 
          Later I was re-stationed to the Mechanical division where I designed and optimized the 
          rear suspension system of the car and developed mathematical equations & algorithms for 
          the calculation of the force distribution of the system using Matlab.
