          I've been working as a Full Stack developer at Tulip. I first began my career in the "Apps" team, which is a 
          frontend driven team that's responsible for delivering the main product of Tulip: the app editor. In the apps team,
          Some of my main contributions include: standardization of error handling pages to a single organized React component, 
          implementation of the user-driven multilingual feature of the apps, and memory performance enhancement  by resolving 
          a critical issue with our scalability for customers with large number of apps.
        </p>
        <p>
          The memory performance enhancement project above led to a whole new team called "Lifecycle" team within our company, 
          where the main focus was to first update the outdated 
          <a href="https://support.tulip.co/docs/import-export-connecting-the-wires">import/export system</a> which had similar
           scalability and stability issues. After moving to the Lifecycle team, my primary contribution was the design and 
           implementation of the new Typescript oriented RESTful API system between the Apps service and the new import/export 
           service.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently I'm working in the "Access" team which primarily focuses on the user account management system and the 
          control of their access to the features within our product. Some of my major contributions include new user-related 
          service implementation and  <a href="https://support.tulip.co/docs/customize-user-roles">custom user role feature</a>, 
          granting more freedom in selecting the permissions for users within the platform. Currently (October 2024), I'm leading
           a project to introduce <a href="https://support.tulip.co/docs/create-and-manage-user-groups">grouping of these users</a>
           in which they can be operated on as a bulk. This has been a very popular request fomr the customers, so that they can 
           remove a lot of inconveniences in having to hard code whenever the customers have to configure users in a bulk, improving
           the generic scalability of our product when used in a large scale.

          I worked as the leader of the Technology Canvas subteam, responsible for the improvement of 
          user convenience and ease of access through a re-design of the UI system and the corresponding data structures 
          of an automobile software that tracks vehicle occupant behavior and pedestrians.
          Utilizing the PyQt5 library, I introduced and adapted a new user friendly interface and platform
          for the creation of the bounding box used for labeling objects within frames. Other tasks included the analysis 
          of the codes written by the past project programmers for the improvement of the readability and the overall code design.

          I served my mandatory military service at the 36th Infantry Division, 109th regiment in 
          Korea as a machinegunner, and was assigned as a squad leader in October 2018 until 
          I completed my service. I led a small team supporting operations 
          and security, and managed disciplinary actions to improve the squad’s combat effectiveness.

          In February 2018, the military provided the government security and

          security maintenance in the Alpensia Sliding Center for games such as Skeleton,
          Luge and Bobsleigh, and also worked as a translator between the staff and the athletes.

          Wolverine Soft is an organization in the University of Michigan where the members meet
          regularly to discuss, make critiques and share their knowledge about video game development
          using Unity Engine. Members also participate in a game development marathon event called
          the Game Jam in which teams consist of programmers, sound engineers and artists develop a
          fully furnished game within 48 hours.

          University of Michigan Solar Car Team is a team that aims for the annual 
          World Solar Challenge. I was initially stationed in the Electrical division, where I was 
          responsible for the design of the cell connections of the battery of the car using 
          Computer Aided Design(CAD) such as Siemens NX and Altair Hyperworks. 
          Later I was re-stationed to the Mechanical division where I designed and optimized the 
          rear suspension system of the car and developed mathematical equations & algorithms for 
          the calculation of the force distribution of the system using Matlab.
