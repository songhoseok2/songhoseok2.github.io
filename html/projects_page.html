            A web application where users can login to publish posts and comments anonymously. 
            The backend of this web app was implemented using flask and SQL Alchemy, while  HTML, 
            Jinja and React were used for the frontened. This web app was inspired from Piazza, 
            a platform used by the University of Michigan for students to ask questions to the 
            class faculty. In the Anony Blog, when a user creates a new post or a comment, a 
            choice is given between revealing the username and going anonymous. An anonymous post 
            hides the Original Poster(OP)'s username and does not show up in OP's list of posts 
            viewable by the public. The OP can choose to reveal or hide the identity in a post 
            or a comment anytime while logged in. In the comment section of a post, all anonymous 
            users are given a unique number that will be used within that post so that the incognito 
            commenters are still distinguishable from each other to avoid confusion in the comments.

            A web application that does Seam Carving (content aware resizing) on images.
            This web app was inspired from one of the university's programming class project.
            I wanted to give a better user interface to this interesting carving algorithm,
            and thus developed this web application using Flask. The application accepts a
            user uploaded image, then proceeds to the resizing page. There, the user resizes
            the displayed image, and whenever any change is made, the python program proceeds
            with the seam carving and returns the result to be uploaded to the server.
            The page then makes a GET request to the appropriate carved image to display the
            result in real time.

            Unlike the conventional filters that provide articles that contain the keyword and 
            discard the rest, this filter in opposite is used to view all the general headlines 
            while discarding the ones that contain the keyword. This filter is useful when the user

            Computerized the old military sentry / guard duty scheduling system by developing a
            C++ program to automatically generate a schedule that is fairer and more efficient
            than creating the schedule by hand. I designed the data structures including a custom
            functor for the priority queue based on the conventional scheduling system and
            modified the program regularly as the scheduling rules changed or as the CO requested.
